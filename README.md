AgriData Explorer – Understanding Indian Crop Patterns Visually
In this project we take real government data about farming in India and turn it into colourful, interactive visuals using Power BI. The goal is to  help people quickly understand how  different crops are doing —like rice,wheat,chickpeas, maize, barley, and others—across various states and years.
The tools we have used here in this project are 

Python  Used for  data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
Power BI to build the dashboard
PostgreSQL Where the farming data is stored

First we collected official crop data from India’s government(the dataset provided).
Then Cleaned it and organised it using SQL and Python.
Used Pandas to load the dataset.
Checked for null values and missing entries in crop-specific columns.Replaced missing values depending on the importance of the field.
Ensured all numerical columns were properly formatted for analysis.
Before building the Power BI dashboard, we used Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the quality and structure of the agricultural data. and created charts in python as well.
Data is been stored in SQL database and answered the queries given 
After we brought it into Power BI Created cards to show total area and production and Made charts to show how yields change over time .
Added KPI charts to show if crops are doing better or worse than expected
We used charts like Map, bar chart, cards, KPI, Line trends, filters etc
So finally in this project we took real farming data from India and built an interactive dashboard using Power BI.We analysed crops like chickpea, maize, and barley, focusing on three key things:
Area cultivated,Total production and Yield (how much was produced per hectare)

Learning from this project is how to clean the data and visualise the data using powebi and make a interactive dashboard.
